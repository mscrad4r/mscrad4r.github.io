# Notice for MSC RAD4R dataset
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# [Notice #1] 8, April, 2024
Hi, everyone. I am the author of the MSC-RAD4R dataset. \\
I have gotten lot's of emails with dataset download speed issues. \\
I apologize for late notice due to my Ph.D. defense. \\
The NAS system was our best, but the internet environment in the lab seems slow. \\
Therefore, I have uploaded the dataset to **Google Drive** for you! \\
I hope that this works well.  :)  \\
Also, my email address in the MSC-RAD4R paper is incorrect. \\
Please send email **mscrad4r@gmail.com**, if you got any issue.\\
However, responses can be slow due to other project deadline.\\
So I recommend that you guys discuss our dataset issue freely on the github forum.\\
Thank you for your great interest in our dataset.

Sincerely, Minseong Choi et al.
